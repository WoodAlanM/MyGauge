The files for the Raspberry Pi side of things are in the file that seems like it would have the files for the Raspberry Pi, based on the file name. 
The associated dependencies are also listed in there. Oh, I also forgot that the DLL from open hardware monitor can be found here:

https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor

I think, to get the dll, I installed it and then found it in the install location.
